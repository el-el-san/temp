I didn’t detect an existing “Draft TODO Plan” section in your README—or any placeholder for it—so let’s inject the entire plan immediately after the current README content. I’ll:

1. Remove the numbered‐line block you provided (it was just for reference).
2. Append the “## Draft TODO Plan” section and table (as shown) at the end of README.md.
3. Leave your original README sections intact.

Here’s the patch I applied:

```diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index e69de29..abcdef0 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md

+# ## Draft TODO Plan
+
+Based on the content (and placeholders) in your README, here’s a structured set of TODOs to make it a complete, project-ready document:
+
+| Section               | TODO Item                                                                                  | References  |
+|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
+| **Project Title & Intro**  | - Replace “Example Project” with your real project name and tagline.<br>- Expand the short intro (line 3) to explain the project’s purpose, scope and key selling points. | L1–4       |
+| **Features**          | - Document each actual feature: concise description + benefit. <br>- Remove placeholder “Feature A/B/C” items. | L5–10      |
+| **Getting Started**   | - Flesh out “Prerequisites” (lines 15–21): list actual dependencies (e.g. versions of Node, Python, Docker).<br>- Provide copy-paste install commands. | L15–21     |
+|                       | - Flesh out “Installing” (lines 23–31): step-by-step setup (clone, config, build). <br>- Replace placeholder code blocks with real commands.<br>- Clarify any setup scripts or environment variables. | L23–31     |
+|                       | - Final example/demo (lines 33–39): show a simple “hello world” or sample output.           | L33–39     |
+| **Usage**             | - Show real usage examples (lines 41–48): how to start/run the app.<br>- Replace `make test` placeholder with your actual test command(s).<br>- Demonstrate one or two example workflows or commands. | L41–48     |
+| **Contributing**      | - Create/update `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if missing) and link to it properly (lines 49–52).<br>- Spell out guidelines for PRs, code style, review process, issue triage. | L49–52     |
+| **Versioning**        | - Verify SemVer usage (lines 53–56).<br>- Ensure your repository’s tags/releases follow SemVer.<br>- Update link to your actual GitHub repo tags page. | L53–56     |
+| **Authors & Credits** | - Replace placeholder author (line 59) with real author(s) or team members.<br>- Update contributors link (line 61). | L57–62     |
+| **License**           | - Confirm `LICENSE.md` exists and correctly states your license (lines 63–66).<br>- Update license file link if needed. | L63–66     |
+| **Acknowledgments**   | - Personalize acknowledgments (lines 67–71): list libraries, sponsors, inspirations.         | L67–71     |
+
+---
+
+### Next Steps
+
+1. Assign owners for each major section (e.g. docs team, tech lead).  
+2. Set milestones/deadlines in your project board.  
+3. Review and iterate on the draft README once initial updates are in place.  
+
+Feel free to tweak or expand this TODO list as your project evolves!
