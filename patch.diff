It looks like this repository does not yet have a `README.md` file, so there’s nothing to update. 

Please make sure you’re running these commands in the correct project folder (where `README.md` lives). If the file is indeed missing, you’ll first need to create it with the placeholder commented lines before applying the example workflow and script.
